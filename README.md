# DSA-C Data Structures and Algorithms in C Programming

A data structure is a method of organizing data in a virtual system. Think of sequences of numbers, or tables of data: these are both well-defined data structures. An algorithm is a sequence of steps executed by a computer that takes an input and transforms it into a target output.
